# TickTackToto - Time Tracker App

A slick ticket time tracker built with React and Firebase.

## Environment Setup

This app requires Firebase configuration to be set up via environment variables for security.

### Local Development

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.firebasestorage.app
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id_here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=default-app-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id_here
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
```

2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase project configuration.

### Deployment

For production deployment (e.g., Netlify), set these same environment variables in your deployment platform's environment settings.

### Google Sheets Export Setup

To enable Google Sheets export:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable Google Sheets API and Google Drive API
3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Web application type)
4. Add authorized JavaScript origins: `http://localhost:3000` and your production domain
5. Copy the Client ID to your `.env` file as `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
